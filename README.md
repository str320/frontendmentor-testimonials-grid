‚úÖ My Process

HTML Structure:

Organized the HTML using semantic elements like `<section>, <article>, and <blockquote>` to clearly define the layout structure and improve accessibility.
Each testimonial is placed inside a `<article>` element for better content organization and semantic meaning.

CSS Grid Layout:

Implemented a CSS Grid layout to effectively position and align the testimonial cards in a responsive grid structure.
Utilized grid-template-columns and grid-column properties to control card positioning and spanning across multiple columns.

Flexbox for Card Details:

Applied Flexbox to handle the alignment and spacing of card details, such as the avatar, name, and verification status.
Ensured consistent spacing and alignment using gap and justify-content.

CSS Variables and Resets:

Used CSS variables to maintain consistent styling across the project (e.g., colors, font sizes, line heights).
Implemented a CSS reset to normalize the default browser styles and create a consistent design foundation.

üöÄ What I Learned

How to implement complex layouts using CSS Grid, allowing for precise control over the placement of each card in the grid.
Applying CSS Variables for reusable and maintainable design tokens, making it easier to update colors, font sizes, and spacing consistently.
Creating visually appealing and accessible card layouts by using semantic HTML elements like `<article>, <blockquote>, and <cite>`.
Effectively using Flexbox to align and space out content within each card, especially for avatar and text alignment.

üîÑ Continued Development

Implement hover effects and animations to make the cards more interactive and visually engaging.
Improve accessibility by adding aria-labels and descriptive alt text for images and icons.
Optimize for larger screens, adding further adjustments for desktop views to maintain a balanced layout.
Implement dark mode styling to enhance visual accessibility and user preference.#
